## How colors work

### Hue

On  the image below we can see the equivalent to Hue being from the range 0 to 1, the Saturation and Value can be any value (so 0-255). To find the color range you want you need to rotate to the left until you find the right Hue range (0-179). We can call the hue as pure color.

### Saturation

Using the Red color as we found in the Hue let's use a Hue between 170-179 & 0-9. In the program, we use set the min Hue to 170 and the max Hue to 9 this should give us most of the Red, but if we want a specific part let's start by changing the Saturation. The previous image can be tricky because not much really changes if we alter the other parameters. Let's use: [Saturation Image](https://github.com/Thecarlosmff/Scripts/blob/c92781933cc3c9e91e6bf81a89226d8f2b8e6c43/Find%20Text/Images/pnghut_depth-color-wheel-photography-theory-magenta-vector-hand-drawn-ring.png).
Applying the settings above we have

Now changing the saturation for something bewteen 200 and 255 we got:

We were capable of reducing the tone that were more pinkish and the less intense red by increasing the lower limit.
So saturation changes the intensity of a color, the higher the saturation more vivid is the color.

### Value

The value determites the amount of light in a color.
Use the previous configuration on another image where we have a value between 0-255 (so anything goes) and decrease the upper limit in the value for 150 the red with more light will disapear.
